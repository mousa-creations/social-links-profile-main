## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

During the coding process, I focused on first building the basic structure of the social links profile using HTML, and then I styled it using CSS to match the design as closely as possible. I utilized CSS flexbox for layout and positioning, and I paid particular attention to implementing hover and focus states for all interactive elements as per the challenge requirements.

In future projects, I aim to further enhance my skills in responsive design and explore advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid layout and CSS animations.
